## 1. Summary

Productized Instagram makeover for Brazilian local-service SMBs (500–20k
followers, visibly weak profiles). Maximally automated pipeline finds weak
profiles, generates a personalized before/after mockup, proves value with a
live DM-automation demo, and pitches via WhatsApp/DM with human-in-loop
sends. Revenue: setup fee + monthly subscription (template kit + DM
automation).

## 2. Goals & success metrics

| Metric | Target | Measured by |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery rate | >95% | `touches.delivered` |
| Reply rate | ≥15% | `v_variant_performance` |
| Reply → meeting | ≥40% | `touches.meeting_at` |
| Meeting → close | ≥25% (≈3% of contacted) | `outcomes.closed_won` |
| Scoring throughput | ≥100 profiles/day | n8n `01-scorer-daily` |
| Human time per qualified prospect | ≤2 min (review + send taps) | operator log |
| Lock criteria | reply ≥15% AND close ≥3% → freeze variants, scale volume | weekly report |

## 3. Users

| User | Needs |
|---|---|
| Operator (Simon) | Zero-friction queues: review 30s/profile, tap-to-send pitches, weekly variant report |
| Prospect (SMB owner) | PT-BR, WhatsApp-first, concrete proof (their own profile made over), instant demo |

## 5. Non-goals

| Excluded | Reason |
|---|---|
| Content management / posting for clients | Product is makeover + kit + automation, not gestão |
| Instagram scraping, cold Cloud API sends, automated cold DMs | Compliance (D-001) |
| Paid traffic services | Out of product scope |
| Multi-tenant SaaS for other agencies | Maybe post-lock; not now |
| Consumer (B2C) profiles | B2B only, LGPD basis is legítimo interesse |

## 6. Constraints

| Area | Rule |
|---|---|
| Meta | Official APIs only; human-in-loop for all outbound |
| LGPD | Public business data; opt-out honored same day; suppression list |
| Language | Prospect-facing = PT-BR; internal = English |
| Brand (dashboard/mockups) | Inter · #6b0f1a <5% · white bg · 1px borders · no shadows |
| Stack | Supabase · n8n · Claude API (haiku-4-5 classify) · Next.js 14 · Python resolver |

## 7. Milestones

| Week | Deliverable | Features |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scorer live, 100 profiles scored | F-101→F-105, F-107, F-108 |
| 2 | Review dashboard + mockup pipeline + demo | F-106, F-201→F-205, F-301, F-302 |
| 3 | First cohort: 100 sends, variant B | F-401, F-402, F-404, F-501 |
| 4+ | Weekly A/B iteration → lock → scale | F-109, F-206, F-403, F-502, F-602, F-603 |

## 8. Open questions

| # | Question | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Meta app review needed for `instagram_manage_insights` at our usage level? | F-102 |
| Q2 | Dedicated WhatsApp number: new chip vs existing business line? | F-402 |
| Q3 | Mockup delivered as image in first message vs after reply (A/B)? | F-401 |
| Q4 | Demo post format on mil&dez profile (reel vs carousel) | F-301 |

## 9. Change log

| Date | Ver | Change | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-05 | 1.0 | Initial PRD from pipeline design + scorer spec | D-001→D-006 |
| 2026-07-05 | 1.1 | F-101 implementation complete (scrape + aggregator follow + Places fallback + suppression/dedupe); stays `building` until ≥70% AC verified on first real batch. Supabase project live (`ejxoageyamogdgwwycvp`, sa-east-1), migration 0001 applied — F-601 view deployed. | F-101, F-601 |
| 2026-07-05 | 1.2 | Added F-110: prospecting (stage 1a) moved into this repo as `scripts/prospect.py`, `done`. First resolver batch on 79 off-ICP pilot rows: 40% auto-resolve — not an AC verdict (B2B clinics, no Places key at the time); fixes shipped (escaped-URL regex, platform-account blocklist, SSL retry). On-segment micro-sample: 3/3 with-website resolved. | F-110, F-101, D-007 |
| 2026-07-05 | 1.3 | First on-segment AC batch (128 prospects, 6 segments): 47% overall, 64% of with-website — 26% of prospects have no website, the structural gap. Added Custom Search JSON API step to F-101 `search` method (official API; zero-overlap picks rejected); activates when `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` is set. AC re-measure pending CSE credentials. | F-101 |
| 2026-07-05 | 1.4 | Google CSE JSON API closed to new customers (sunsets 2027-01-01) — unusable for us. Web-search step now uses Brave Search API (`BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`, ≈$5/1k, $5/mo free credit); CSE branch kept for grandfathered configs only. Same token-match guard. | F-101 |
